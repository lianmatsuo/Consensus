                <p>
                    Our demo acts as a simulator to provide a dynamic and interactive platform to model the problem of 'Consensus'. 
                    Analysing how individual votes propagate and influence outcomes in a networked environment. Utilising 
                    <a href="https://js.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape.js</a>, our tool offers users an intuitive interface to visualise and
                     explore; an invaluable resource for understanding the intricacies of network-based decision-making processes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The demo consist of a directed graph of nodes. Where through synchronous iterations, nodes can only "pull" from 
                    its target. When a node pulls from its target it will have a probability of taking the target's colour or maintain it's
                     own colour ('opinion'). However, if the target node is off, then the source node does nothing. Each node has a uniform 
                     probability of pulling from any adjacent node.

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            The demo simulator can seem confusing with it's numerous different functions and buttons.
            Our goal with the simulator is to reach consensus! Whereby our simulation only exists a single
            'opinion', in other words, all nodes that are 'on' are of one colour.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's go through how you can observe how different "opinions" interact! 
        </p>
        <br>

        <div class="small_container">
            <h2>Selecting Starting nodes </h2>
            <p2>
                Before starting the simulation, first assign at least two different colours to two different nodes. 
                These colours help represent different 'opinions' within the network of nodes. There are already two 
                buttons designated for assigning two different colours: purple and green. You can also add a more colours
                 to observe the effects of having 3 'opinions'.
            </p2>
            <h3>
                This can be achieved with these buttons:
            </h3>
            <div class="container">
                <button class="btn">Assign Purple Node</button>
                <button class="btn">Assign Green Node</button>
                <button class="btn">Add Colours</button>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="small_container">
            <h2>Iterating</h2>
            <p2>
                You can choose to iterate through the simulation manually, one iteration at
                 a time with each click of a button. This allows you to observe the influence of selected 
                 'opinions' at your own pace. However, if consensus is reached in one of the iterations, 
                 it will not display that information to you and you can choose to continue to iterate 
                 through the graph of nodes. 
            </p2>

        <div class="small_container">
            <h2>Simulating</h2>
            <p2>
                You can run the simulation until consensus is reached. 
                The application will continue to automatically iterate step by step 
                until a consensus is reached.

        <div class="small_container">
            <h2>P-Value</h2>
            <p2>
                The p-value specifies the probabilities of a node not pulling from a colour.
                 By default, when the p-value is not set, the node's probability of doing nothing
                  is the same as the probability of pulling an 'opinion' from a single adjacent node.
                When you set the p-value, the remaining probability will be uniformly distributed
                to the node's adjacent nodes. So, the probability of choosing an adjacent node 
                is the same probability of choosing another adjacent node. However, the probability
                 of not doing anything will be different.
